## Not Professional Advice

This software, including all associated policy templates, control mappings, questionnaire templates, evidence templates, agent governance frameworks, and documentation (collectively, the "Materials"), is provided for **informational and educational purposes only**.

The Materials do not constitute and should not be relied upon as legal advice, compliance advice, audit guidance, regulatory guidance, or any other form of professional advice. The Materials are not a substitute for the services of a qualified attorney, certified public accountant (CPA), or licensed compliance professional.

## No Guarantee of Compliance

Use of these Materials does not guarantee compliance with SOC 2, ISO 27001, ISO 42001, GDPR, HIPAA, or any other regulatory, legal, or industry framework. Compliance with any framework requires a formal assessment by a qualified professional who evaluates your specific systems, processes, and organizational context.

The policy templates, control mappings, and questionnaire responses included in the Materials are **starting points and examples**. They must be reviewed, customized, and validated by qualified professionals before use in any compliance program, audit engagement, or client-facing context.

## No Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the authors, contributors, and maintainers of this project shall not be held liable for any damages, losses, penalties, fines, audit failures, regulatory actions, security incidents, data breaches, or other adverse outcomes arising from or related to the use or misuse of the Materials, including but not limited to:

- Reliance on policy templates without professional review
- Use of generated Trust Center content as a representation of compliance status
- Submission of generated questionnaire responses to clients, auditors, or regulators
- Failure to achieve or maintain compliance with any framework
- Security incidents occurring despite controls described in the Materials
- Any action taken or not taken based on the Materials

## Your Responsibilities

By using these Materials, you acknowledge and agree that:

1. **You are responsible for your own compliance.** The Materials provide a framework and starting point. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your policies, controls, and practices meet the requirements applicable to your organization.

2. **You must engage qualified professionals.** Before relying on any policy, control mapping, or compliance documentation generated by this software, you should have it reviewed by a qualified attorney, CPA, or compliance professional familiar with the applicable framework and your jurisdiction.

3. **You must validate all generated content.** AI-generated policy text, questionnaire responses, gap assessments, and Trust Center content must be reviewed for accuracy, completeness, and applicability to your specific situation before use.

4. **You must maintain your own compliance program.** This software is a tool to assist with compliance management. It does not replace the need for ongoing governance, monitoring, training, and professional oversight.

5. **You must not misrepresent your compliance status.** Generated Trust Center pages, compliance summaries, and questionnaire responses reflect the data you provide. You are responsible for ensuring that any compliance claims made to clients, prospects, or regulators are truthful and substantiated.

## AI-Generated Content

Portions of the Materials, including policy templates, control descriptions, and questionnaire responses, were authored or assisted by AI language models. AI-generated content may contain errors, omissions, or inaccuracies. All AI-generated content should be treated as a draft requiring human review and validation.
